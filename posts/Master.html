<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cells (PSTC) have reached a record power conversion
    efficiency (PCE) of 29:5%, outperforming their Si-based counterpart and making them excellent
    candidates for third generation solar cells. However, to facilitate their commercialization,
    degradation effects need to brought under control, ensuring long-term stability. For this purpose,
    perovskite solar cells (PSC) have been studied intensively in recent years.
    In this thesis, a fully operational organic-inorganic halide perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell
    was characterized. Specifically, the possible correlation between lattice strain and elemental
    distribution or local performance using multi-modal X-ray microscopy techniques at sychnotron
    facility was investigated.
    The characterization is mainly focused on the analysis of the X-ray diffraction data. With a
    nanometer resolution measurement, multiple isolated crystallites were identified and a strong
    intergrain variation in the lattice spacing could be seen. Due to homogeneity of the X-ray beam
    induced current (XBIC) signal in this scale, the local performance could not be correlated to
    any other signal. The crystallites could be divided into core and boundary and a meta analysis
    is done with respect to the lattice parameter.
    Furthermore, rocking curves of individual crystallites were performed and the intragrain strain
    was investigated. It was found that individual grains could endure multiple scans before the Xray
    diffraction signal disappeared as a result of degradation effects. A characteristic distribution
    of the intragrain strain and a statistical peak in the rocking curve were observed. However,
    due to lack of data, the broadness of the diffraction peak could not be calculated.
    At last, using the data of a long-term irradiation measurement, light-induced decay of the
    diffraction signal could be unveiled and quantified. A correlation between degradation rate
    and lattice strain could be established.</p>
