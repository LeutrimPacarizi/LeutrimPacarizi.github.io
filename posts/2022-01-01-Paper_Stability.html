<h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>

<p>A ferrocen layer is introduced between the perovskite and the fullerene layer. This increases the stability, so that the cell could withstand 85Â°C heat test and 85% humidity with an power conversion efficiency of 25%. This perovskite solar cell successfully passed the main point of IEC61215:2016 qualification for damp and heat condition</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>This layer configuration (with the ferrocen) is patented by the university of Hong Kong.</li>
