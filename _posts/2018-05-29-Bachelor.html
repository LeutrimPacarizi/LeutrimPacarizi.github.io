<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>This thesis is about a setup for field emission measurements, which offer the potential to be inserted into a spectrometer for protein mass determination. The aim of this thesis is to construct this setup in a way that it does not show field emission by itself and can reach high electric fields without generating an electrical breakdown. In addition, the reproducibility of the measurements shall become increased. During this work, the single components (Teflon, Kapton, PEEK) are studied for their suitability to be inserted into this setup. Furthermore, the infuence of diffrent preparation methods (contacting, cutting) of these components to the maximum reachable electric field and the reproducibility of the measurements is investigated. Moreover, different grids and structures as well as the application of a torque spanner during assembling are researched.</p>
